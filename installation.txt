Installation for localhost
--------------------------

Make a new virtualenv for the project, and run:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Then, you'll need Redis running locally; the settings are configured to
point to "localhost", port 6379.

Finally, run:

    python manage.py migrate
    python manage.py runserver

Usage:

Make  a superuser account:

    python manage.py createsuperuser

Then, log into http://localhost:8000
